# Convolutional Self-Modeling Spiking Elastic Liquid Neural Network (CSMSELNN) with Hebbian and Homeostatic Neuroplasticity

## Abstract

This paper presents the Convolutional Self-Modeling Spiking Elastic Liquid Neural Network (CSMSELNN), a novel architecture designed to process complex spatio-temporal data. By incorporating Hebbian and homeostatic neuroplasticity principles, CSMSELNN dynamically adjusts its structure, enhancing adaptability and learning efficiency. This framework effectively combines convolutional layers with a self-modeling spiking reservoir, improving performance in tasks such as digit classification on the MNIST dataset.

## Introduction

Traditional neural network models face challenges when managing dynamic data characterized by spatio-temporal dependencies. Static architectures limit adaptability, leading to inefficiencies in learning and performance. CSMSELNN addresses these issues through self-modeling mechanisms that enable the network to predict its internal states and dynamically adjust its structure based on real-time performance metrics.

## Statement of the Problem

### Limitations of Static Neural Networks

- **Fixed Architecture**: Conventional models operate with predetermined structures, limiting their capacity to adapt to evolving data complexities.
- **Inefficient Learning**: Static frameworks struggle to optimize performance in tasks that require ongoing adjustment to spatio-temporal data.
- **Manual Intervention**: Optimizing neural network parameters often necessitates extensive manual tuning, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

### Need for Dynamic Adaptation

There is a pressing need for neural networks that can adapt their structures based on ongoing performance metrics, particularly in applications requiring complex data management.
