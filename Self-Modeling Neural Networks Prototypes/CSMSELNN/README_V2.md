# Documentation: Convolutional Self-Modeling Spiking Elastic Liquid Neural Network (CSMSELNN)

## 1. Problem Statement

The goal of this project was to develop an advanced neural network model capable of efficiently learning and classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The primary challenge was to design a network that adapts dynamically to its input data and can achieve high accuracy while avoiding overfitting.

## 2. Architectural Model Design

### 2.1. Model Overview

The CSMSELNN combines convolutional layers, self-modeling spiking neurons, and elastic synaptogenesis mechanisms to create a model that adapts its structure during training. This model is designed to handle spatio-temporal data effectively by incorporating both convolutional and recurrent layers.

### 2.2. Layers

#### Convolutional Layers:

- **Conv2D**: Three convolutional layers (32, 64, and 128 filters) with ReLU activation and same padding are used to extract spatial features from input images.
- **MaxPooling2D**: Two max-pooling layers are used to downsample the feature maps, reducing dimensionality and computational load.

#### SynaptogenesisLayer:

- A custom layer that simulates synaptogenesis (the formation of new synapses) and pruning (removal of less useful synapses) based on the model's performance.
- Includes parameters like spectral radius, leak rate, spike threshold, and maximum reservoir dimension to control the reservoir's behavior.

#### Recurrent Layer:

- An RNN layer with the SynaptogenesisLayer is used to process the temporal aspects of the data, incorporating spiking behavior and dynamic synaptic adjustments.

#### Dense Layers:

- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation and dropout are used for final classification. Regularization is applied to prevent overfitting.

#### Output Layers:
- **Classification Output**: For digit classification with softmax activation.
- **Self-Modeling Output**: To reconstruct input images, aiding in self-modeling.

## 3. Mechanisms Involved

### 3.1. Synaptogenesis

The model dynamically adjusts its reservoir size and weights through:

- **Addition of Synapses**: Based on performance metrics and growth thresholds.
- **Pruning of Synapses**: Reduces connections based on thresholds to eliminate redundant or less useful connections.

### 3.2. Spiking Behavior

The SynaptogenesisLayer simulates spiking neurons where:

- **Spiking**: Occurs when neuron states exceed a threshold.
- **Leak Rate**: Controls the decay of neuron states.
- **Spectral Radius**: Ensures stability of the reservoir's dynamics.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1. Code Overview

The code imports necessary libraries, defines custom layers, and builds the model using TensorFlow/Keras. Key components include:

- **SynaptogenesisLayer**: Manages dynamic reservoir growth and pruning.
- **ExpandDimsLayer**: Adjusts input dimensions for compatibility with RNN layers.
- **SynaptogenesisCallback**: Manages growth and pruning phases based on performance metrics during training.

### 4.2. Data Preparation

Data is normalized and split into training, validation, and test sets. The model is trained with the MNIST dataset, and callbacks such as EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau are used to optimize training.

## 5. Results and Discussion

### 5.1. Training Results

The model demonstrated rapid learning with training accuracies increasing from 67.03% to 99.18% over 10 epochs. Validation accuracy improved from 97.60% to 99.02%.

### 5.2. Test Results

The final test accuracy reached 99.19%, indicating excellent generalization to unseen data.

### 5.3. Callback Behavior

The SynaptogenesisCallback effectively managed reservoir growth and pruning, contributing to the model's adaptability and performance.
