## Abstract

This paper introduces the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Self-Modeling Convolutional Gated Spiking Elastic Liquid Neural Network (DST-SM-CGSELNN), a novel neural network architecture that integrates several advanced techniques. The model combines convolutional layers, spatio-temporal summary mixing, gated spiking neurons, elastic reservoir computing, Hebbian and Homeostatic Neuroplasticity, and self-modeling mechanisms. When tested on the MNIST dataset, the DST-SM-CGSELNN achieves a test accuracy of 99.21% and a 100% confidence in correct predictions, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex spatio-temporal data.

## Introduction

Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved image classification tasks. However, challenges remain in developing models that can adapt to changing environments, incorporate biologically plausible learning mechanisms, and possess self-modeling capabilities. The DST-SM-CGSELNN aims to address these challenges by introducing a dynamic architecture that evolves based on input data and performance metrics.

## Problem Statement

1. **Limitations of Static Neural Networks**: Conventional neural networks often have fixed architectures determined before training, which limits their ability to capture the nuances of evolving datasets.
2. **Need for Dynamic Adaptation**: There is a growing need for neural networks that can autonomously adjust their structure and parameters, particularly in applications dealing with dynamic or complex data.

## Model Architecture

The DST-SM-CGSELNN incorporates several components:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract hierarchical features from input data.
2. **Spatio-Temporal Summary Mixing Layer**: Captures spatial and temporal dependencies.
3. **Gated Spiking Elastic Liquid Neural Network**: Mimics biological neurons and allows dynamic complexity.
4. **Hebbian and Homeostatic Neuroplasticity Layer**: Implements biologically inspired learning mechanisms.
5. **Self-Modeling Mechanism**: Develops rich internal representations through auxiliary tasks.
