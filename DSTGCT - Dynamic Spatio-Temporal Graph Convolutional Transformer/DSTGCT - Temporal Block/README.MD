# **Temporal Block**

The Temporal Block focuses on capturing temporal dynamics and changes over time. For this block, the following neural networks are well-suited:

1. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Traditional RNNs, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), are effective at learning temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in time series data.

2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Addresses vanishing gradient problems and is good for learning long-term dependencies.
3. **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: Simplifies LSTM by combining the forget and input gates into a single update gate, improving efficiency while retaining performance.

4. **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)**: TCNs use convolutional layers to capture temporal patterns and can be more efficient than RNNs for certain tasks. They are designed to handle long-range dependencies and parallelize computations.

5. **Dilated Convolutions**: Enhance TCNs by allowing for a larger receptive field without increasing the number of parameters significantly.

6. **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**: For tasks requiring precise temporal resolution, SNNs model the temporal dynamics of spikes and are well-suited for capturing high-resolution temporal patterns.
